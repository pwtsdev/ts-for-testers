# TypeScript for Testers

Welcome to the **TypeScript for Testers** course repository – built by the [<pwts.dev>](https://pwts.dev/) team.

This course is your fast track to mastering **TypeScript** as a tester, whether you're starting from scratch or strengthening your understanding of JavaScript’s typed superset.

This repo contains all the code examples, homeworks, and solutions from the course, structured clearly by modules and lessons for easy navigation.

## What You’ll Learn

This course covers the **core foundations of TypeScript** with a focus on practical use in test automation.

You’ll learn how to work with variables, primitive types, type conversions, and control flow. We’ll also dive into more advanced concepts like functions, union types, arrays, objects, interfaces, and modules.

Throughout the course, you’ll build real code examples, complete hands-on homework assignments, and gain confidence using TypeScript to write clean, predictable, and maintainable test code.

By the end of the course, you’ll be ready to **write your first automated tests with Playwright and TypeScript** on your own.

## Why TypeScript for Testers?

As testers, we strive to **break things better**. TypeScript helps you:

- Catch errors early (even before tests run 🚀)
- Write more robust test scripts
- Improve readability and maintainability

This course is here to help you **level up**. Ready? Let’s code 🎯.
