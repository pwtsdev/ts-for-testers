# TypeScript for Testers

Welcome to the **TypeScript for Testers** course repository â€“ built by the [<pwts.dev>](https://pwts.dev/) team.

This course is your fast track to mastering **TypeScript** as a tester, whether you're starting from scratch or strengthening your understanding of JavaScriptâ€™s typed superset.

This repo contains all the code examples, homeworks, and solutions from the course, structured clearly by modules and lessons for easy navigation.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

This course covers the **core foundations of TypeScript** with a focus on practical use in test automation.

Youâ€™ll learn how to work with variables, primitive types, type conversions, and control flow. Weâ€™ll also dive into more advanced concepts like functions, union types, arrays, objects, interfaces, and modules.

Throughout the course, youâ€™ll build real code examples, complete hands-on homework assignments, and gain confidence using TypeScript to write clean, predictable, and maintainable test code.

By the end of the course, youâ€™ll be ready to **write your first automated tests with Playwright and TypeScript** on your own.

## Why TypeScript for Testers?

As testers, we strive to **break things better**. TypeScript helps you:

- Catch errors early (even before tests run ðŸš€)
- Write more robust test scripts
- Improve readability and maintainability

This course is here to help you **level up**. Ready? Letâ€™s code ðŸŽ¯.
